  title: 'Mintimer Shaimiev: "If not us, then who?"'
  desc: 'The biography of Mintimer Shaimiev — the path that the republic has passed from the 1990s to the present. Standing at the helm of Tatarstan, he not only managed to build a dialogue with the federal centre on an equal footing, but also became one of those thanks to whose efforts Russian federalism was formed. He has done a lot for the development of the industrial and economic potential of the republic, preserving and strengthening for Russia the unique production facilities operating on the territory of Tatarstan. Thanks to the decisions taken — often pioneering on a national scale — the largest projects have been implemented, important not only for Russia, but also of global importance. "If not us, then who?" is one of the main tenets of the life of the first president of Tatarstan.'
