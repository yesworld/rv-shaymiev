    text: '\tI have a lot of memories associated with the first president of the Republic of Tatarstan, Mintimer Sharipovich Shaimiev. He gave me a lot of wise advice, he allowed me to look at many things and processes of public administration in my own way. For example, when I worked for the first six months, and I was a young minister, once I came to him with a work report. I walk into the office, he looks at me with squinted eyes - he has such a special habit of smiling narrowly - and says from the very threshold: "Well, Marat, is your yoke heavy? "Yes, Mintimer Sharipovich, it is!" "You don\'t just have it heavy, you also have it with nails, it will hurt until it bleeds! And you also should understand, doing your big and important work, that most likely no one will thank you for it. But this should not stop you, you should not be disappointed in your work, but should work for people." \n'
        + '\tI remember these words that he said to me all my life. I have been in public administration for more than twenty years. We are criticised sometimes, rightly, sometimes unfairly. Sometimes we do some important things, for example, as with shared construction participants it happens that we have been solving these problems for years, we spend a huge amount of effort and energy on this, we even go to the edge of what is permissible to solve people\'s problems, and we do not expect gratitude. Remembering these words, I am already philosophical about this. This is our mission, we have to work for people. \n'
        + '\tIf we turn to his human, organisational and political qualities, of course, he is a very extraordinary person. He was ready to make serious and extraordinary decisions, which at that time were very unpopular. For example, regarding the programme for the resettlement and liquidation of emergency housing, no one in the country was doing this at that time, and it was necessary to have a great political will to make the decision on the resettlement of the centre of Kazan and putting it in order. Twenty years have passed since this decision, and today those who come to Kazan say that this is a really beautiful city. If you remember Kazan as it was twenty years ago, the situation was completely different. This decision - to remove dilapidated housing from the central part of the city and the whole city, when there was no money and opportunities, to make such a bold decision - this is the extraordinary thinking and courage of the actions of Mintimer Sharipovich Shaimiev. \n'
        + '\tAnother serious step was when we started housing and communal services reform with him. At first, I discussed in detail with Rustam Nurgalievich Minnikhanov when he was Prime Minister, then I went to report to the president, and we made a number of serious and extraordinary decisions. For example, complete financial recovery of all housing and communal services enterprises. We had more than three hundred housing and utilities companies, and they were unprofitable. There was a vicious circle in this situation, it was necessary to make a decision about financial recovery. After that, enterprises began to pay taxes, salaries, and the collection of payments became ninety-eight percent. It was an extraordinary decision, no such decisions had been made in Russia at that time. \n'
        + '\tHe is a man capable of bold and extraordinary decisions, thoughtful, not of unconsidered actions. Many believed that his decisions were beyond the risk, but it was the thoughts of those who did not understand Mintimer Sharipovich Shaimiev. He was meticulous about many things. And he also has a very developed sense of intuition by nature. Life has shown that, indeed, everything that we did with him, all the issues that we outlined with him, everything turned out to be implemented. \n'
        + '\tOn my own behalf, I want to wish him good health, he is a man in good athletic shape and regularly swims. I wish him to live to be a hundred years! That\'s my wish for him.\n',

    text: '\tI am sure that I am among those people who have every right to call Mintimer Sharipovich their teacher. My first teachers were my parents, then colleagues in the Komsomol and the party in my native Almetyevsk, and when I moved to Kazan, I had only one mentor — Mintimer Shaimiev. It was from him that I learned to think, make projections, understand and convince, and make decisions. \n'
        + '\tI was lucky enough to work hand in hand with him for many years. During this time, there were a lot of incredible stories, discussions… Their results resulted in the most fundamental political decisions that he, as the first president of Tatarstan, always made for the benefit and in the interests of his native republic and the whole of Russia. \n'
        + '\tCertainly, the formation of Tatarstan as an advanced, dynamically developing, strong region of the country with its interethnic and interfaith harmony is inextricably linked with the name of Mintimer Shaimiev. In the crucial years of modern history, thanks to his wisdom, responsibility and political will, he managed to unite the people of Tatarstan around the idea of building the future of the republic on the basis of constitutional equality and democratic order. \n'
        + '\tThe activities of Shaimiev as president largely laid the foundation for the unique \'model of Tatarstan\', characterised by effective interaction with the federal centre, the implementation of well-thought-out economic strategy, and the situation of social and inter-ethnic stability. The strategy adopted at that time largely became the basis of the modern successes of Tatarstan, which continues its progressive development under the leadership of Rustam Minnikhanov— a man who gradually moved forward, consistently passing all levels of power in the "Shaimiev team". \n'
        + '\tThroughout his life, Mintimer Shaimiev selflessly has served his native republic. The largest cultural and humanitarian projects have become a new stage of its activity. The revival of Bolgar and Sviyazhsk, the construction of the Kazan Cathedral, the development of the network of multilingual schools “Adymnar - the path to knowledge and harmony” — all this is a vivid manifestation of the creative power that Mintimer Shaimiev personifies for his fellow citizens. \n'
        + '\tThat is why, it seems to me, he has always had and still has the most valuable thing for a politician – the trust and support of the population, the authority and respect of colleagues and opponents - regardless of their nationality, religion, age, profession or ideological beliefs. \n'
